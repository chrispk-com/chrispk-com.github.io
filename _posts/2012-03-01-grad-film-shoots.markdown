One of only two worthwhile photos that I'm aware of having taken (or at least still have a record of) during the 6 six weeks of graduation film shoots that took place in early 2012 as a part of the BA (Hons) Film Production course at The Arts University at Bournemouth.

Acting rehearsals with the boxers (one of which is famous footballer Jamie Redknapp) who, positioned at each edge of frame, are partially obscured by the boxing ring rope in the foreground.

Apart from the wide shot of the boxing ring (above) I seem to remember that trying to get good shots from outsite of the ring, where I was working, was not easy. Hopefully it was easier (and more planned of course) where the actors were rehearsing.
