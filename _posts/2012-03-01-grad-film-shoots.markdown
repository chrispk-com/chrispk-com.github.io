One of only two worthwhile photos that I'm aware of having taken (or at least still have a record of) during the 6 six weeks of graduation film shoots that took place in early 2012 as a part of the BA (Hons) Film Production course at The Arts University at Bournemouth.

Apart from the wide shot of the boxing ring (above) I seem to remember that trying to get good shots from outsite of the ring, where I was working, was not easy. Hopefully it was easier (and more planned of course) where the actors were rehearsing.
