I travelled to South Africa at the end of October to attend meetings with some of the country's sports and entertainment broadcasters during the inaugural [Adweek Africa][adweek-africa] event in Johannesburg. Adweek was ultimately cancelled due to [violent events][gauteng-violent-events] related to xenophobia which had occurred recently but the meetings, in which I was representing YouTube as a Partner Technology Manager, still took place.

I arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday, 31st October, and stayed in the city for 7 nights. This time was mostly spent working but in the evenings I enjoyed checking out Johannesburg's upscale restaurants, such as sister restaurants [Marble][marble-restaurant] and [Saint][saint-restaurant], and visiting the [Aparteid Museum][apartheid-museum], an impactful and slightly overwhelming experience, on Sunday.

On Thursday, 7th November, a week after arriving I hired a car and took a couple of days off to explore some of the areas around Johannesburg.

Based on a coleagues recommendation I visited the [Lion and Cheetah Sanctuary][lion-and-cheetah-santuary] in Pretoria where I was told there would be baby lions and cheetahs. After arriving I soon learned about the dark nature to venues where 
but meeting and interacting with the domesticated adult cheetahs was an amazing experience.

I royally messed up [my visit to Cape Town](link) but the 2 days I spend in the Gauteng and North West provinces were pretty great!
