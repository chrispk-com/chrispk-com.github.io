I travelled to South Africa at the end of October to attend meetings with some of the country's sports and entertainment broadcasters during the inaugural [Adweek Africa][adweek-africa] event in Johannesburg. Adweek was ultimately cancelled due to [violent events][gauteng-violent-events] related to xenophobia which had occurred recently but the meetings that had been arranged, where I was representing YouTube as a Partner Technology Manager, still took place.

I arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday, 31st October, and stayed in the city for 7 nights. This time was mostly spent working but in the evenings I enjoyed checking out Johannesburg's upscale restaurants, such as sister restaurants [Marble][marble-restaurant] and [Saint][saint-restaurant], and visiting the [Aparteid Museum][apartheid-museum], an impactful and slightly overwhelming experience, on Sunday.

On Thursday 7th November, a week after arriving, I hired a car and a colleage and I took some time to explore some of the areas around Johannesburg.

Another colleague had recommended that we visit a [Lion and Cheetah Sanctuary][lion-and-cheetah-santuary] in Pretoria to see baby lion and cheetah cubs. As it turned out there were no cubs and I learned, soon after arriving, about the deeper moral issues of breeding or aquiring cubs to attract tourists - a topic which recent show, Tiger King, has shed more light on. However seeing and interacting with the domesticated adult animals - which I understand were rescues and could not be let back into the wild - was an amazing experience.

This cheetah's name is Bolt. We got on well.

The cheetahs were kept in fairly large enclosures, presumably to protect the nearby game.

The giraffes were extremely skittish, presumably more-so because of their calf, so it wasn't possible to get much closer to these animals. Every time I moved they would look up and stare at me for some time before cautiously going back to grazing on the neary foliage.

The Lion King (of the [Lion and Cheetah Sanctuary][lion-and-cheetah-santuary])

The lions, of which there was 1 male (pictured above) and 2 females, were kept in a seperate enclosure to the cheetahs. All of them were all asleep. This is mot meant judgungly. However seeing them here was when I started to discover just how much lions sleep - 23 hours a day!

The 2 lioness' were both quite - or very - overweight. It turned out that this was related to the contraception they had been prescribed.

I need to admit I found this quite funny. I don't think I'd ever considered the concept of medicinal contraceptives for animals and it raised many questions. Are there different versions of "the pill" available? Does it affect their mood?

After we left the santuary I dropped my colleage, who was flying Cape Town, at the airport and then began to drive north towards Pilanesberg National Park.

One thing I had been advised against was doing this journey at night. My colleage making the recommendations had hit an animal many years ago when making the return journey to Johannesburg at night. He was lucky to make it back to teh city safely.

By the time I was on route I was running late. With an hour until dusk and a 2 hour journey ahead of me this was going to be a night time drive through the outback of <region names>.

I royally messed up [my visit to Cape Town](link) but the 2 days I spend in the Gauteng and North West provinces were pretty great!
