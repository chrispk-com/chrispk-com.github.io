Posting this about 10 months late. This was taken over Christmas in December 2018.

The long exposure works well to exaggerate the fairy lights and the sense of Christmas.

I took several exposures (between 20 and 30 seconds in length) with no other illumination than the fairy lights on the Christmas tree. As it happened the first photo (the shortest exposure) was the best. The rest were either over-exposed or were subject to some motion blur.
