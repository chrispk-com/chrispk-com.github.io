Just after the tents were set up.

The soft backlighting on the leather gives the furniture a unique look.

A shot inside the coffee shop that in my mind resembles exactly what's like in many coffee shops in Amsterdam.

{% assign image = page.album[3] %}{% include print_album_image.html %}

One of the instantly recognizable lanes in Amsterdam city centre with token head shop on the right hand side.

{% assign image = page.album[5] %}{% include print_album_image.html %}

A more conventionally composed shot of the one of the streets adjacent to the canal.
