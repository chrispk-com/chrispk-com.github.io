It's been just over 10 years  (10 years, 3 months and 6 days to be exact) since I was last in New York.

I visited in June 2023 for work - a business trip which ended up extending to San Francisco at the last minute - as YouTube were hosting a [News Working Group event][news-working-group] at their offices on Hudson Street.

Outside of work I spent a few days exploring (and re-exploring) the city.

It is actually a little difficult to get good photos of the Empire State Building from the Rockefeller Center. The two buildings are not quite aligned for a perfectly symmetrical view and the closer you are to the ideal positioning the more tourists there are huddled together in the corner of the [Top of the Rock Observation Deck][top-of-the-rock].

After color correction, and some heavy-handed use of Google Photo's 'Pop' adjustment filter (also known as [Clarity][adobe-lightroom-clarity] in Adobe Lightroom), I've come to quite like the mist and the moody atmosphere created by the reduced visibility.

Central Park on a misty afternoon.

I like how this view gives a real sense of Manhattan Island. The Hudson river is visible in the background on the left and the size of Central Park, sprawling across the middle of the island, can be seen clearly.

The perspective issues, and resulting asymmetry, are clearer in this photo of the Empire State Building at dusk.

There were even more tourists huddled together in the optimal corner of the observation deck when this photo was taken. In order to get a usable photo I had to remove the viewfinder of the SLR (after first using it to set exposure), then hold the camera upside down above my head and use the ground glass for framing.

North Tower Pool of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.

I didn't make it to New York's financial district when I was here 10 years ago but was glad I made it down this time. The way that the real estate of World Trade Center's historic two towers have been artistically memorialized was impressive and meaningful.

New York City skyline.

Taken from the free Staten Island ferry. I quite like how this turned out.

Dumbo (Manhattan Bridge View), Brooklyn.

There was no queuing system for the teams of wannabe influencers that were posing for a photograph with Manhattan Bridge in the background. Your 'turn' was based mainly on how much risk you were willing to take with the oncoming traffic.

Looking west down Water Street in Brooklyn (from somewhere near the intersection with Washington Street).

This might be my favourite photo from this trip.

Taken close to sunset, the harsh lighting conditions really push the limits of the {{ album.film_stock }} film stock with lots of grain visible (after colour correction) and only the most essential detail surrounding Brooklyn Bridge being retained in the highlights. I particularly like the way the incident sunlight reflects off of the windows creating pools of light across the cobblestone road.
