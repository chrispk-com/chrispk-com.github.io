I couldn't fly to South Africa as early as I wanted to because the Nigerian High Commission were processing my visa application.

When I received my passport on Wednesday, November 1st, I rearranged my flights to the next day.

Thursday was chaos...

Travel vaccines.

Anti-malarials.

Packing.

Accomodation (booked whilst travelling to the aiport).

I landed in Johannesburg on Friday morning, caught a connecting flight to Cape Town at 13:45 and was finally in an Uber to my hostel at around 5pm.

I met my colleagues, who had been in Cape Town for a few days, for dinner at about 8pm.
