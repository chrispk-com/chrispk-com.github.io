A portrait someone took of me. I suspect this was taken well before Secret Garden Party 2010.

The *Is Land*, a Â£12,000 art peice which was cut from it's tethers at 3am on Sunday, was last seen in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, 400 metres up. Speculators think it might have made it to Slovenia. Here's [The Guardian's article][] (cached [here][cached Guardian article]) on the floating island.

Another are peice...

I've no idea who these people were. I think I said I'd get this photo to them... somehow.

One of the woman in the group pictured above.

Taken during a visit from Dec and Freyja whilst on shift at *The Boneyard*.

I worked shifts at the *The Boneyard*, an equipment store for festival build and maintenence. As the festival was built and maintenence was sparce there was quite a lot of time for photography experimentation and maybe some sleeping.

Whilst the vivid colours here are pretty I particularly like the way the tungsten bulbs are exposed against the sky, capturing the lighting and tone of magic hour.

Not a lot happened at *The Boneyard*.
