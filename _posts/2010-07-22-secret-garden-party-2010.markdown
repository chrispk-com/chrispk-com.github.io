  I attended The Secret Garden Party (an arts and music festival which used to be held in Cambridgeshire, UK, around July) in 2010. See photos of the 'Is Land' (a floating art peice which was cut from its tethers during SGP), festival goers and some of my experimental photography taken whilst working shifts at 'The Boneyard' (the festival's equipment store).

A portrait someone took of me. I suspect this was taken well before Secret Garden Party 2010.

The *Is Land*, a Â£12,000 art peice which was cut from it's tethers at 3am on Sunday, was last seen in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, 400 metres up. Speculators think it might have made it to Slovenia. Here's [The Guardian's article][] (cached [here][cached Guardian article]) on the floating island.

I worked shifts at the *The Boneyard*, an equipment store for festival build and maintenence. As the festival was built and maintenence was sparce there was quite a lot of time for photography experimentation and maybe some sleeping.

One of the woman in a group of festival-goers that passed by, who are also pictured below.

I've no idea who these people were. I think I said I'd get this photo to them... somehow.

Whilst the vivid colours here are pretty I particularly like the way the tungsten bulbs are exposed against the sky, capturing the lighting and tone of magic hour.

Not a lot happened at *The Boneyard*.
