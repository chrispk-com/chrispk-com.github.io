![The 'Is Land', a floating island]({{ page.album[0] }} "The 'Is Land'")

The *Is Land*, a Â£12,000 art peice which was cut from it's tethers at 3am on Sunday, was last seen in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, 400 metres up. Speculators think it might have made it to Slovenia. Here's [The Guardian's article][] (cached [here][cached Guardian article]) on the floating island.
