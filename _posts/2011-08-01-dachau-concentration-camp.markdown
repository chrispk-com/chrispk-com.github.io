excerpt: >
  I visited Dachau Concentration Camp whilst on a spontaneous trip to Germany (planned and set off within a couple of hours) with my housemate in 2011. See photos taken inside the buildings of the Dachau Concentration Camp facility and of the courtyard, barracks and museum exhibits.

Intentionally quite under-exposed. Reflective of the dark history of the building.

Dachau Concentration Camp's main courtyard.

Remains of Dachau Concentration Camp's fence in the foreground and barracks in the background.

I felt this exhibit was slightly more upsetting than the rest of Dachau's museum. If I recall correctly this was an actual cane used when the concentration camp was in operation.

This sculpture, called *The March of Death*, portrays prisoners of the concentration camp in line for the gas chamber. Whilst being quite upsetting, I found this to be the most powerful peice of art in the museum. The slightly deformed, mishapen nature of the people as well as the texture of the metal make this peice feel very grim reflecting the awful historical nature of the subject.
