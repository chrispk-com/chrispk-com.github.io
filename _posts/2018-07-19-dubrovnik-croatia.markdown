I loved Dubrovnik and it's beautiful 'Old Town' area - a preserved, medieval city surrounded by huge stone walls. This shot of Fort Lovrijenac a 16th-century seaside fortress in which lot of Game of Thrones seems to have been shot, and the surrounding area are located just outside of Old Town.

On our first visit to Old Town I lose track of my credit card so head back to the apartment to appease my anxiety (turns out I left it on the kitchen counter). I expect my friends to check out Old Town during my absence. Instead I find them sitting in a touristy cafe, just off of the right edge of frame of this shot, thinking Old Town wasn't very impressive.

I like the level of long-distance depth in this image - seeing into the medieval streets of Old Town all the way up to the hill top overlooking the capital. I feel that this image captures the overall environment of Old Town well.

What happens when you hand a manual film camera to first unsuspecting tourist carrying an D-SLR...

I severly regret not taking a shot overlooking Old Town from this vantage point.

A better photo, taken by another much more confident tourist.
