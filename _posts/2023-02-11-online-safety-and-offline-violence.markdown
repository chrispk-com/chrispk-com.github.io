I've been working in the News on Social Media space for the last 6 years. Whether it's me or the current culture, debates around this have heated up over the last few years with polarization between free speech and online safety.

Before getting into details I want to start by clarifying that I am generally very anti-censorship and believe that access to information should not be restricted.

However in my experience many of these debates end up getting caught up in balancing online freedom - including the freedom to be 'violent' online (e.g. verbal harrasment, expressions of hate) - with offline violence. By this I mean real-world, physical violence being enacted.

During my initial research I came across a paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) titled [Can Social Media Rhetoric Incite Hate Incidents? Evidence from Trump's "Chinese Virus" Tweets][nber-papers-w30588] (also including an [archived version of page from Dec 12th, 2022][nber-papers-w30588-archive]. You can find the PDF of the paper [here][nber-papers-w30588-pdf] (or on this [this self-hosted mirror][nber-papers-w30588-pdf-mirror].

Page 3 of the paper starts with the following paragraph:

> "Our work complements a handful of other studies that have examined anti-social effects of the specific content disseminated through media, including research showing that radio programming in Rwanda calling for the extermination of the Tutsi minority had a significant impact on participation in killings by militia groups and ordinary civilians (Yanagizawa-Drott 2014); that radio content incited anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi acts by ordinary citizens (Adena et al. 2015 and Wang 2021); and that the fictional portrayal of the KKK in the film The Birth of a Nation caused lynchings and race riots in the United States in the early 20th century (Ang 2020). Our work also complements recent research on social media showing that county-level Twitter penetration reduced the Republican vote share in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections without having any effects on Congressional elections and previous presidential elections (Fujiwara, MÃ¼eller, and Schwarz 2021)."

The purpose of this research is to further investigate and summarise these examples. My hypothesis, as the paper seems to support, is that for Social Media to allow total freedom of speech there will be increased real-world, physical violance as a consequence. Therefore, unless real-world violence is somehow accepted, some suppression by social media companies is required.

One assumption I am making in the above argument is that freedom of speech on Socia Media also entails some degree of 'freedom of reach'.
