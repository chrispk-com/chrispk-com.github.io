I loved Croatia's capital city, Dubrovnik. Although quite touristy (and therefore pricey) it maintained a strong sense of culture.

On our first visit to Dubrovnik's 'Old Town', a well-preserved area from the 16th century, I lose track of my credit card and decide to settle my anxiety by heading back to the apartment (where I found I've left it on the kitchen counter). During my trip home and back I expect my friends to check out 'Old Town'. Instead they sit in a cafe, just off of the right edge of frame of this shot, thinking 'Old Town' wasn't that impressive.

This view of Fort Lovrijenac, a 16th-century seaside fortress where a lot of Game of Thrones is shot, was taken whilst walking along the giant city walls which surround 'Old Town'.
