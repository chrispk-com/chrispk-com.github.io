[Hvar Island][hvar-island]{% include anchor-attributes.html %}.

This shot overlooks the islands main settlement, a port town also called [Hvar][hvar-town]{% include anchor-attributes.html %}.

There are a couple of nightclubs on the island, Pink Champagne and Carpe Diem. We made the mistake of going to Pink Champagne. It was as trashy as the name suggests (not that I have a huge problem with that) but didn't really have anything else to offer.

[Carpe Diem][carpe-diem-hvar]{% include anchor-attributes.html %}, in retrospect, was where we should have gone. Not actually on the island of Hvar, Carpe Diem was a club which a required a boat ride to reach. Writing this over 6 months later I stillm experience some FOMO thinking about it.

Whilst on Hvar we did visit Carpe Diem's associated bar (also called Carpe Diem) which was on the mainland. The music there was unexpected - I have distinct memories of hearing [Opus by Eric Pritz][opus-eric-pritz]{% include anchor-attributes.html %} and it's never ending crescendo for the first time whilst wandering around drink in hand.

I did not get enough photos from the festival. The few others I did take were not very good.

Tisno bridge.

I like the high contrast, fast-shutter effect of this image.

The drawbridge connects Murter Island to the town of Tisno, on the mainland, are just 38 metres apart. I felt [this video](tisno-bridge-jump), which shows the moment someone drove over the bridge whilst it was being raised, was worth including.

My plans to hike up the festival site's neighbouring hill (and, of course, get a photo) were foiled by mild alcohol poisoning which dampened the last few days spent in Tisno.

I settled, and mildly insisted, on driving up another nearby hill on our departure from Tisno. The roads were confusing and getting to the top took far longer than expected but the views were worth it.

Partially obscured by hilltop foliage you can see The Tisno Garden (the festival site) and The Argonaughty (the iconic party boat).

The Adriatic sea.

I don't have a lot to say about this photo despite using it as the cover image for this post. I like the way this photo convey's the beauty, freedom and fun of island hopping in Croatia (and other Adriatic coutries).

The last day of the trip. This was the first time I experienced being on holiday and feeling too hot.

It was about 36 degrees outside and we were unable to find anywhere with aircon. We were all ready to go home but our flight didn't leave for several hours.
