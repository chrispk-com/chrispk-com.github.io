These photos needed considerably more colour correct than normal.

Hvar Island.

This shot overlooks the islands main town, also called Hvar.

There are a couple of nightclubs on the island, Pink Champagne and Carpe Diem. We made the mistake of going to Pink Champagne. It was pretty much as trashy as the name suggests (not that I have a huge problem with that) but didn't really have anything else to offer.

Carpe Diem, in retrospect, was where we should have gone. Not actually on the island, Carpe Diem was a beach/club that you had to take a boat to get to. We did visit what I believe to be Carpe Diem's associated bar on the mainland (also called Carpe Diem). The music there was different but surpirsingly good - I have distinct memories of listing to Opus by Eric Pritz and not knowing what was going on.

Writing this over 6 months later I can still visualize and experience FOMO thinking of what Carpe Diem could have been.

I did not get enough photos from the festival. The few others I did take were not very good.

Tisno bridge.

Very high contrast, fast-shutter image.

The drawbridge connects Murter Island to the town of Tisno, on the mainland, are just 38 metres apart.

[This viral video](tisno-bridge-jump) shows the amazing moment someone drove over it as it was raising.

My plans to hike up the festival site's neighbouring hill (and, of course, get a photo) were foiled by mild alcohol poisoning which dampened the last few days spent in Tisno.

I settled, and mildly insisted, on driving up another nearby hill on our departure from Tisno. The roads were confusing and getting to the top took far longer than expected but the views were worth it.

Partially obscured by hilltop foliage you can see The Tisno Garden (the festival site) and The Argonaughty (the iconic party boat).

The Adriatic sea.

I don't have a lot to say about this photo despite using it as the cover image for this post. I like the way this photo convey's the beauty, freedom and fun of island hopping in Croatia (and other Adriatic coutries).

The last day of the trip. This was the first time I experienced being on holiday and feeling too hot.

It was about 36 degrees outside and we were unable to find anywhere with aircon. We were all ready to go home but our flight didn't leave for several hours.
