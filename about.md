Chris P-K is just some guy that wanted to put his photography (and other content) online independent of other blogging platforms. This site is built with [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] but could really be served from anywhere.

Chris P-K is short for Chris Park-Kennaby although his Facebook name was 'Chrispy Kay' for many years and some of his friends still know him as Chrispy.

Chris is 30 years old. He is English. He was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and grew up in Devon. He also has a twin! Here's a photo where they look very similar:

They've never taken a test to confirm if they are identical so you can be the judge of their "zygosity" :)

Chris currently lives in London and works for Google as a YouTube Partner Technology Manager.
