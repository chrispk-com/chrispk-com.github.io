Just some guy that wanted to put his photography (and other content) online independent of other blogging platforms. This site is built with [Jekyll][jekyll] and hosted using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] but could really be served from anywhere.

Chris P-K is short for Chris Park-Kennaby although my Facebook name was 'Chrispy Kay' for many years (some of my friends still know me as Chrispy).

I am 30 years old. I'm English. I grew up in Devon. I also have a twin! Here's a photo where we look very similar:

We've never taken a test to confirm if we are identical so you can be the judge of our "[zygosity][zygosity]" :)

I currently live in London and work for Google as a YouTube Partner Technology Manager.
